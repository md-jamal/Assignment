VPATH : - Searching directories for prerequisites.
	- Variable
vpath : - Selective searching directories for prerequisites

MAKEFLAGS : - Recursive invocations of 'make'.
	    - Options passed through the variable

automatic variables : $% - The target member name, when the target is an archive member. *Note Archives::.  For example, if the target is `foo.a(bar.o)' then `$%' is `bar.o' and `$@' is `foo.a'.  `$%' is empty when the target is not an archive member.
		      $@ - Target name
		      $^ - All prerequisites and no duplicate 
		      $+ - All prerequisites and duplicates also
		      $? - all prerequisites that are never than the target
		      $< - First prerequisite
		      $* - similar extension files form prerequisites (pattern match)


Makefile options : 	-v = version
			-h = help
			-C = change directory
			-o = Avoiding recompilation of old(some) file.
			-k = keep going as much as possible after an error
			-S = no keep going i.e. cancle the effect of the -k option and mostly used in recursive makefile
			--trace = show tracing information off make execution
			-i = Ignore errors
			-I = include directory
			-s = silent i.e. dont display any commands on terminal
			-d = print debugging information (--debug=a(all)/v(verbose)/ etc))
			-n = list out the commands or just print
			-p = print databases
			-j = jobs (-j4 i.e. number of jobs to execute simulteniously)
			-t = touch i.e. mark them up to date without realyyy changing them
			-f = selecting files
			-B = always make if it is up to date also
			-w = print the message containing the working directory
			--no-print-directory = reverse of -w


Standard veriables : CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, CC, INSTALL, MAKEFLAGS or MFLAGS

Standard Targets for users : all - Compile the entire program
			     install - Compile the program  and move the file to respected directory.
			     clean - Delete all files created by this makefile
			     distclean - Delete all files created by this makefile(.config file also)
			     check - perform self-tests (if any)
			     

'-' = Ignore error
'+' = Execute commands if it is in do not execute mode.(eg. make -n option)
'@' = Don't display the command on screen 

% - pattern matching like (%.o : %.c)
Wildcard : * = selectiong all files form directory and which will work on shell commands

Setting veriables :   	+= -> Appending or concatination
			:= or ::=  -> simply expanded veriables
			= -> recursively expanded
			?= -> If you'd like a variable to be set to a value only if it's not already set, then you can use the shorthand operator `?=' instead of `='.
			!= -> This operator first evaluates the right-hand side, then passes that result to the shell for execution.


Special built-in target names : 
	.PHONY : There are two reasons to use a phony target: to avoid a conflict with a file of the same name, and to improve performance. It contains only targets which are not file created by commands or recipe.
	.INTERMEDIATE :
	.SECONFARY : 
	.DELETE_ON_ERROR : If error came, dont create target
	.IGNORE : to ignore errors for target
	.SILENT : dont display commands
